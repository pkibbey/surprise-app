# Surprise App: Unexpected Delight! ‚ú®

A simple application designed to deliver a random, delightful surprise. Perfect for adding a little spark of joy to your day!

The goal is to offer a quick, uplifting moment for anyone who needs it. This project serves as a fun exercise in basic TypeScript development and demonstrates the power of random selection to brighten someone's day.
